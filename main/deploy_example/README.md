# Basics of Model Training and Web App Deploy

This example set of code is meant to show a simple approach to training a classifier model and using streamlit + FastAPI to host the model as a web app, allowing a user to input data and get a prediction. There are two videos in this directory that 

1. Describe the model training process and...
2. Demonstrate the web app

Please note that the development of this model is prototyping level only. Production level model development would involve much more EDA, training exercises, performance metrics, and optimizations.
